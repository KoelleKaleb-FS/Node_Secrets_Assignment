# Node_Secrets_Assignment# Node Secrets Management - Part 1: Hardcoded Secrets

This is the first part of a project demonstrating different approaches to managing secrets in a Node.js application. In this part, the application includes hardcoded secrets directly in the code, showcasing the risks and limitations of this approach.

---

## Description

The application uses a hardcoded API key to demonstrate how secrets can be directly embedded into the source code. While functional, this approach is highly insecure and unsuitable for production environments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system (download from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)).
- Git installed (download from [Git](https://git-scm.com)).
